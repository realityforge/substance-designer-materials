# Rocky Ground

This material is inspired by the rocky paths around hard sandstone cliffs such as Mt Arapiles and the Grampians in Australia.

This material was originally created to support the student project "A Few Screws Loose" where it was as part of the cave floor. The time frame for material creation was short but the material turned out as desired except for the roughness layer.

The reference images were all personal photos and the tutorial series ["Substance Designer - Mountain Path"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJqG6MA-Og_J2AVtONYMGRZVVjXBbxWqR) by [Nathan Mackenzie](https://www.artstation.com/nathanmackenzie) provided inspiration for some subgraph parts.
